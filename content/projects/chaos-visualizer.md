## üåÄ Interactive Journey through Chaos Theory

This application provides **interactive visualizations** of fundamental concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. Through hands-on exploration, discover how simple mathematical rules can generate incredibly complex and beautiful behaviors.

### What You'll Explore

- üèãÔ∏è **Double Pendulum**: Experience sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- üåÄ **Lorenz Attractor**: The butterfly effect in action
- üåø **Bifurcation Diagrams**: How systems transition from order to chaos
- üìà **Lyapunov Exponents**: Quantifying chaos mathematically
- ‚ú® **Hopf Explorer**: Advanced dynamics of oscillation birth through bifurcations

Each visualization is designed to be **interactive and educational**, allowing you to adjust parameters and immediately see how the system responds. No advanced mathematics knowledge required ‚Äî just curiosity!

### üí° Featured: Hopf Explorer

The **Hopf Explorer** represents the culmination of my undergraduate thesis research:

*"Atravesando lentamente una bifurcaci√≥n de Hopf"* (Slowly Crossing a Hopf Bifurcation)

This section explores the fascinating delay phenomenon when systems slowly transition through critical points, with applications in neuroscience and climate dynamics.

### Purpose & Motivation

Chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics are fundamental to understanding complex systems in nature, from weather patterns to neural activity. This application bridges the gap between abstract mathematics and intuitive understanding by providing **real-time, interactive visualizations**.

### Educational Approach

Each module is designed with education in mind:
- **Intuitive controls** to explore parameter space
- **Real-time visualization** of system dynamics
- **Theoretical background** sections explaining the mathematics
- **Practical insights** connecting theory to real-world phenomena

### Technical Implementation

Built with Python using:
- **Streamlit** for the interactive web interface
- **NumPy & SciPy** for numerical computations
- **Plotly** for responsive, interactive plots
- **Scientific computing** techniques for accurate simulations

### About the Research

The Hopf Explorer section implements research from my undergraduate thesis in Mathematics at Universidad de Oviedo (2023), supervised by Prof. Santiago Ib√°√±ez Mesa. This work studied:

- **Slow passage effects** through Hopf bifurcations
- **Delay phenomena** in dynamical systems
- **WKB asymptotic methods** for quantifying delays

This project showcases the beauty of mathematical rigor and the wonderful interplay between abstract theory and real-world phenomena. What begins as purely mathematical analysis ‚Äî involving complex time, asymptotic expansions, and geometric singular perturbation theory ‚Äî reveals profound insights into how neurons fire, how climate systems transition, and why nature often "hesitates" at critical points.
